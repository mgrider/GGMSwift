# Generic Game Model - Swift

The Generic Game Model (GGM) project seeks to provide relatively simple classes to facilitate easy creation of 2D games for iOS, primarily using UIKit.

This repository contains a rewrite of GGM in modern Swift. The original [Generic Game Model](https://github.com/mgrider/GenericGameModel) project was written in Objective-C.

## Installation

TODO

## Usage

Typically you would subclass both `GGM_Game` (your model), and `GGM_UIView` (the view, or rather the top level `UIView`, or visual representation of your game), and override just a few functions for your own purposes. See the example project classes `ExampleGame` and `ExampleGameView`.
